ErrorHandling solidity Program

This Solidity program demonstrates a simple token contract named "MyToken" with basic functionalities such as minting, burning, transferring tokens and also the use of error handling statements.


Description

The MyToken contract is written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functions to mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, transfer tokens between addresses and use of error handling statements. This program serves as a basic introduction to token management in Solidity and can be used as a foundation for more advanced token projects.


Getting Started

Executing the Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at Remix.
Create a New File:
Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
Compile the Code:
Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version).
Click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
Deploy the Contract:
Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.
Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Deploy" button.
Interact with the Contract:
After deployment, you can interact with the contract's functions (mint, burn, transfer).
For example, to mint tokens:
Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar.
Enter the address and the number of tokens to mint in the mint function input fields.
Click on the "transact" button to execute the function.
